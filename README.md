Nightlife? Let's be real.  If I'm not in bed by 10, I'm reading, watching a movie, or coding.  Let's talk about _quiet places_, those oases of sanity that give introverts living in an extrovert's world the much-needed respite to release our tensions.  Unfortunately, extroverts will sometimes creep into these spots and, craving external stimulation, ruin our nice calm.  The Quietlife Coordinator is a platorm for introverts to organize and crowd out people who may insist on **human interaction**.
